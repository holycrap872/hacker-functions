# Hacker Functions

This project is designed to teach students the importance of testing and CI/CD.
This is done by asking students to find a series of subtly seeded bugs and then
to capture that knowledge with a red/green test.

The bugs in the repo escalate in difficulty from relatively simple bugs all the
way up to bugs that mimic some of the most impactful security flaws every seen.

## Setup

In general, students will do the following:

1. Clone/fork a copy of this project
2. Create their own branch to work on
3. Write a series of tests to illustrate the bug in a particular function
4. Push their tests plus a "bug-fix" to create a true "red/green test"
